# Dynamic Pricing Dataset
# Maximize revenue and profitability by dynamic pricing



## About Dataset

A ride-sharing company is aiming to optimize its fare system by implementing a **dynamic pricing strategy** that responds to real-time market conditions. Historically, the company has used only ride duration to determine fares. Now, the goal is to utilize data-driven techniques to analyze historical ride data and develop a predictive model. This model will dynamically adjust prices based on various factors.

### Dataset Overview

The provided dataset includes historical data with the following features:

- **Number of Riders**: Total riders per trip.
- **Number of Drivers**: Available drivers at the time of booking.
- **Location Category**: Classification of the pickup location.
- **Customer Loyalty Status**: Indicates if a customer belongs to a loyalty program.
- **Number of Past Rides**: Total completed rides by the customer.
- **Average Ratings**: Average rating given to drivers by customers.
- **Time of Booking**: When the ride was booked.
- **Vehicle Type**: Type of vehicle used for the ride.
- **Expected Ride Duration**: Estimated time for the ride.
- **Historical Cost of the Rides**: Past fare for similar rides.

### Objective

Your task is to build a **dynamic pricing model** that incorporates these features to predict optimal fares for rides in real-time. The model must consider demand patterns and supply availability to make accurate fare predictions.
